# Formal Language and Automaton Concepts

This project explores the concepts of formal languages and automata and includes practical implementations of them in various programming languages.

## Included Projects:
  
- [Regex to Delta-NFA Conversion](https://github.com/calcuttarain/conversion-regex-to-delta-nfa)
  - A C++ program for converting a regular expression into a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) using the Î´-NFA technique.

- [Finite State Automaton](https://github.com/calcuttarain/finite-state-automaton)
  - A Python implementation of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and operations for manipulating it.

- [Grammar Checking] (https://github.com/calcuttarain/verificare-cuvant-pentru-o-framatica-LFA)
  - A simple implementation in Python of an algorithm to check if a word belongs to a given grammar.
