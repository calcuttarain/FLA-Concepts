# Formal Language and Automaton Concepts

This project explores the concepts of formal languages and automata and includes practical implementations of them in various programming languages.

## Included Projects:

- [https://github.com/calcuttarain/Conversion-of-Regular-Expression-to-Finite-Automata](link to Python project)
  - A Python implementation of the algorithm for converting a regular expression into a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).
  
- [https://github.com/calcuttarain/conversion-regex-to-delta-nfa](link to C++ project)
  - A C++ program for converting a regular expression into a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) using the Î´-NFA technique.

- [https://github.com/calcuttarain/finite-state-automaton](link to Python project)
  - A Python implementation of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and operations for manipulating it.
